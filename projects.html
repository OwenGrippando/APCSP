    <p class="s">My first project is my information search that I made during my freshmen year. I made it in my english class and the topic revolves around death and the afterlife in different cultures. In completing the project I needed to conduct interviews and do a lot of resarching online. I learned a lot from this experience and it broadened my knowledge on the topic.</p>

    <p class="s">My second project is my preformance task that I made in my APCSP class. The topic of the project is of traveling around the world to the best location and hotels in that location. In completing the project I needed to do research with my group on the top rated hotels in specific locations around the world. I learned how to write up code on a topic and the different prices of hotels that are five star.</p>
